# The Impact of Technical Wordings in Promotional Emails
In the competitive food delivery industry, effective advertising is crucial for success. UberEats, a major player, is exploring the impact of technical language like acronyms and jargon on subscriber engagement in their promotional emails, challenging the assumption that simpler ads are always better.

This study focused on active UberEats subscribers in New York City, the study uses stratified sampling to randomly assign participants to control and treatment groups. Statistical analyses, including chi-squared tests, will reveal how technical language influences click-through rates, with the ultimate goal of providing practical insights for UberEats and potentially benefiting the broader food delivery industry. 

## Research Plan

In this study, we zoom in on the technical language within UberEats promotional emails. To provide a clearer recommendation, we're specifically looking at the use of jargon and acronyms. Our hypothesis posits that promotional emails with more than three technical terms in a 95-100 word ad are more impactful than those without any technical language. Subscribers will be randomly assigned to three email types: without technical language, with over three jargon words, and with over three acronym words. The final step involves using the chi-square test to pinpoint which group uses the coupon most frequently.



## Hypothesis

We have chosen a confidence level of 95% for rejecting the null hypothesis (H0). Regarding the first research question, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject H0, indicating a statistically significant difference in customers' inclination to view promotional emails with varying levels of technical language. Similarly, for the second research question, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject H0, signifying a statistically significant difference in customers' inclination to view promotional emails with different levels of acronyms.

## Sample Selection

For sample selection, we employed stratified sampling to ensure a representative sample that captures the diversity of our target population. Stratification was based on customers' past yearly expenditures on Uber Eats. We aimed to gauge sensitivity to specific elements within each stratum by organizing customers into five spending categories in the last 6 months: $50 and less, $51-$100, $101-$150, $151-$200, and $201 and more. This approach aligns with best practices, considering both the recommendation of using no more than 4-6 stratification variables and 6 strata in a sample, as well as accounting for recently signed-up users with no previous order history.

## Statistical Plan

Our statistical plan involves employing the Chi-square test, suited for categorical data, to assess the influence of acronyms and jargon in our study. We have pre-established effect sizes, with 0.30 for acronyms and 0.35 for jargon. To ensure the statistical power of our test, we set a target power of 0.8 and determined our sample size accordingly. Enhancing the reliability of our findings, we plan to repeat the simulation 1,000 times. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a robust and thorough statistical analysis of the impact of technical language in our study.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

The main limitation identified is the potential for selection bias in this study. The sample is exclusively drawn from UberEATS subscribers, restricting the generalization of our conclusions to a broader population. For instance, if there's a proven difference between UberEATS subscribers and the general population of food delivery service customers, our findings may not apply universally. Additionally, if UberEATS subscribers generally have a higher income than Chowbus subscribers, the conclusions from this study may not be applicable to Chowbus subscribers.
