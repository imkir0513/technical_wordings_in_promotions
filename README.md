# Technical wordings in Emails
In the fiercely competitive food delivery industry, effective advertising plays a pivotal role in maintaining market dominance. UberEats, a prominent player, seeks to optimize its promotional emails by understanding the impact of technical wordings, specifically acronyms and jargon, on subscribers' engagement. Contrary to conventional wisdom, which suggests simplicity in advertising, this study explores whether advanced language influences customers' inclination to click on promotional materials. Focused on active UberEats subscribers in New York City, the research employs a stratified sampling approach, randomizing participants into control and treatment groups. Statistical analyses, including chi-squared tests, will gauge the significance of technical wordings on click-through rates. The study aims to provide actionable insights for UberEats, with potential implications for the broader food delivery industry.
